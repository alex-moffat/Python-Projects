Cords and computers
In all shapes and colors
Discarded circuit boards
Sticking out of forgotten crates

We have been collecting paraphernalia
Since 1984
Thirty-six years
Maybe twenty computers
Five I-pads for the two of us

You would think by now
I would know everything about technology
I thought I knew a lot
Until my work decided to go online

Now I wish I had not stopped learning
For as I teach myself GoogleClassroom and GoogleTranslate
Abd How to make YouTube videos and run a Zoom room
I feel I know nothing at all
About technology

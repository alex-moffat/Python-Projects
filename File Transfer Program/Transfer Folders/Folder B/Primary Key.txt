A table can have one primary key,
it should be unique for each row.
On one or many columns it might be,
two a composite key you know.

A row can be identified by it,
a telephone number of kind.
A fine way to get data I admit,
the correct data it will find.

A primary key must never be null,
it's there so it must be legit.
A modest integer field might seem dull,
but I don't see a better fit.
